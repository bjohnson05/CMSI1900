               <td><p>OK, we all know what the Internet is, right?  It's typically considered a <q>where</q> that
                      is like some <em class='underline'>place</em> that we <q>visit</q> to get information.  But

                      Internet] is a whole collection of machines and wires and hardware and software all working
                      together in combination to deliver us the information we seek.</p>
                   <p>If you think of the name as a combination of two words, <q>inter</q> [a prefix meaning

         <p>If the Internet is just a big collection of stuff, we can sort of think of it like a restaurant.  When
            I go in to get something to eat, I sit down at a table, the server comes over and asks what I'd like.
            I tell them my preference, then they go off to the kitchen to place my order.  When the order is ready,
            the server brings it back to me and I get to chow down on green eggs and ham or whatever.</p>
         <p>The analogy with the way the Internet works, called the <strong>client/server model</strong>, is very
            much the same thing.  The computer terminal would be the client [me, the hungry customer], with the
            Internet hardware and software being the <q>server</q> [we'll see a slightly different version of this
            in a minute], and the kitchen [the remote site] is where my data [food] is kept.</p><br />

         </table>
         <br />
         <p>Remember there's a <em class='underline'>whole bunch of actions</em> that happen behind the scenes here
            in this drawing, like address translation, routers sending things to other routers, packetizing of the
            data, looking up where the specific data is located, and on and on and on.  Still, this diagram gives
            you an idea of what happens when you want to visit <a href='www.lmu.edu'>www.lmu.edu</a>.</p>
         <p>To illustrate the idea of client/server, let's try an experiment with the joke <q>Knock-Knock</q>.  As
            you may remember, the joke goes:</p>
         <p><em class='underline'>First person</em>: <q>Knock Knock</q></em></p>
         <p><em class='underline'>Second person</em>: <q>Who's there?</q></em></p>
         <p><em class='underline'>First person</em>: <q>Boo</q></em></p>
         <p><em class='underline'>Second person</em>: <q>Boo who?</q></em></p>
         <p><em class='underline'>First person</em>: <q>Why are you crying?</q></em></p>
         <p>In this case, I have constructed [thanks to the
            <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html'>Oracle Java
            Examples</a> website] a client/server application which does the joke and illustrates the idea.  The
            server program, along with an associated <q>Protocol</q> class, handles the joke part, taking the
            place of the first person above, and the client program, which takes the place of the second person in
            the process and is run separately.  The Java code is available on my GitHub repo at:
            <a href='https://github.com/bjohnson05/CMSI1900'>this link</a> &mdash; feel free to download copies of
            the code if you have Java installed on your computer.  I will try to run the server on my computer and
            have one or more of you run the client and connect to run the joke simulation.  [Hope it works!]</p>
         <p>In this simulation, the server starts things off when it gets a connection from the client, by responding
            to the connection from the client with the message "Knock knock" that will show up on the client's
            display.  The client then must type "Who's there?" on the line and press enter, so the server will get
            thatas its response.  The server then replies to the client with a random selection from a table of
            possible joke lines, and the process continues like that until the joke completes.  Once the punch line
            of the joke appears on the client's display, the server asks <q>Do you want another? (y/n)</q> to see
            if the client wants another joke.</p>
         <p>[The server program has two parts because one part ~ <code>KnockKnockServer.java</code> ~ handles the
            connection and the other part ~ <code>KnockKnockProtocol.java</code> ~ handles the messages and the
            <q>state</q> of the joke progress.}</p>

         <h2 style='margin-top: 1.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em'>Internet and Network Addressing</h2>
         <p>How do the computers know were to 'go' to get the information?  Think of it like the Amazon driver who
            is delivering a package.  She needs to know an <strong>address</strong> where she can drop your package
            off on the front porch, right?  That address is how she knows she has the right house.  Network addresses
            serve the same function, but in both directions &mdash; giving the client an address of the server which
            holds the information, and giving the server the address of the client to which the information should be
            returned.</p>
         <p>Network addresses are made up of four numbers, each of which has 8 bits.  That makes up the 32-bits of
            the source and destination address fields in the header.  You are probably familiar with them, even if
            you didn't know that's what they are.  They look like <strong>192.168.123.234</strong>.  Each number
            in the series is made up of one 8-bit value, which is why each number is sometimes referred to as an
            <strong>octet</strong> [<q>oct</q> means <q>eight</q>].  The numbers translate to networks and to
            sub-networks and sub-sub-networks, so that the hardware [and software] which is in between the two
            <strong>end points</strong> can tell what the <strong>route</strong> should be to get the information
            packet to its destination.  We'll learn about 'packets' next.</p>
         <p>From the machinery standpoint, it is easy for them to pick the values apart, look up in a table to see
            what the next step in the route would be, and send the packet along to that next address in the chain.
            This is what <strong>network routers</strong> do.  However, it is much harder for humans to be able to
            remember specific number sequences of numbers like thise.  For example, what if every time you wanted to
            view the LMU home page, you had to type the number sequence <strong>52.38.76.44</strong>?  Or to get to
            Google for an Internet search, which would be a different set of numbers [172.217.10.142]?</p>
         <p>Fortunately, there are two organizations that help out here.  First of all there is the the Internet
            Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers [<a href='www.icann.org'>ICANN</a>] which is a non-profit
            organization that assigns the names to the network address octets.  You pay a fee to own the name.
            Names are <em class='underline'>registered</em> and are called <strong>domains</strong> or <strong>domain
            names</strong>.  For example, the address 52.36.76.44 is registered with the ICANN for the domain
            <q>lmu.edu</q>.</p>
         <p>The second organization is related to the <em class='underline'>name translation</em> that happens so
            that humans can remember the names rather than the number sequences.  The <strong>Domain Name System
            [DNS]</strong> performs the translation based on the approved names from the ICANN.  It is essentially
            a series of computer servers with big look-up tables that match the names that have been assigned to
            the numeric addresses to which they translate.  This look-up occurs <q>behind the scenes</q> within the
            web browser application, so you never have to be aware it's happening [unless something goes wrong].</p>
         <p>Remember: EVERY device that is connected to the Internet needs an IP Address.  Otherwise this system
            won't work!  If YOUR computer didn't have an address, you could send a message to a remote computer
            [like www.lmu.edu] to get their web page, but the LMU server wouldn't know where to send the page back
            to you.  On the other hand, if the LMU server didn't have an address, NO ONE would know how to connect
            to it to get information!</p>
         <p>[BTW, you can look up the numbers for any domain name if you want, by visiting the
            <a href='https://dnslookup.org/'>DNS Lookup</a> site which is maintained by the DNSLookup Organization
            for just such a purpose.</p>

         <h2 style='margin-top: 1.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em'>Packets</h2>
         <p>So, how does any computer know which computer to talk to on the other end of the connection?  It's all
            done with the idea of <strong>addresses</strong>, specifically <strong>TCP/IP addresses</strong>.</p>
         <p>When you order a package from Amazon, you must give them a delivery address, so that they know where
            to ship your merchandise, and so that FedEx knows onto which truck to put it and what street and house
            at which to drop it off.  Your house has a street address that is useful for that kind of situation.
            In the same way, every device that is networked has a <strong>network address</strong> which uniquely
            identifies that device on the network.  Going back to the diagram above, when the user enters a web
            address like <q>https://myweb.lmu.edu</q> to visit a page on the Internet, the web browser breaks the
            request message into small chunks called <strong>packets</strong> which are sent over the network to
            the server.  On the server end, the packets are put back together to form the complete message again.
            Inside each of those packets are TWO addresses: 1) the address of YOUR computer; and 2) the address of
            the SERVER computer that the request is destined to reach.</p>
         <p>Each packet resembles the following:</p>
         <p style='text-align: center; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em'>
            <img src='../private/networkpacket.jpg' alt='Network Packet' width='900' height='300'
                 title='Hand-made on my home whiteboard' /></p>
         <p>As you can easily see, there is a BUNCH of stuff that is added to your data when you send it across a
            network.  The black box marked <q>USER DATA</q> is the actual data that is being sent.  However, as it
            moves through the system, there is another set of data added, called a <strong>header</strong>, which
            creates the <strong>packet</strong> and contains information needed to properly transmit and receive
            that information.  The first header that is added is put on by the <strong>Transport layer</strong> of
            the system [we'll see that later] and makes the user data into a <strong>TCP Segment</strong>.</p>
         <p>The second header that is added is done by the <strong>Internet layer</strong> and makes the packet
            into an <strong>IP Datagram</strong> by adding the <q>IP Header</q>.  Finally, the last header added
            is done by the <strong>Network Access layer</strong> adding the <q>network header</q> so that the whole
            message is now called a <strong>Network-level Packet</strong>.  It is this packet that is sent along
            the <strong>transmission medium</strong> to the other end of the connection.</p><br /><br />
         <table>
            <tr>
               <td><p>Just for information so that you can see what is typically in a <em>header</em>, you can see
                      on the right that there are a number of fields, made up of specific bytes of information to
                      assist with the transmission.  A few fields in this diagram show you the point of packets.</p>
                   <p>First, the <em class='underline'>version</em> and the <em class='underline'>header length</em>
                      fields make sure that all the devices in the chain know what protocol version should be used,
                      and how many bits to allow for in this packet.</p>
                   <p>Next, look at the fields called <em class='underline'>source address</em> and
                      <em class='underline'>destination address</em>.  Notice that these are 32-bit values.  We'll
                      see more about addresses in a minute.</p>
                   <p>Also note the <em class='underline'>identifier</em> and <em class='underline'>fragment offset</em>
                      fields which help the other end reassemble the packets into the message that started out.
                      Since it is not guaranteed that all packets will be sent through the exact same network path
                      they may arrive at the destination out of order if one path takes longer than another.</p>
                   <p>Finally, notice that packets are small, meaning you can send a LOT of different packets from
                      MANY different sources to MANY different destinations, since their small size helps let the
                      network mingle them together so that <q>everyone gets a little attention quickly</q>.  If a
                      single long message was allowed to tie up the network, all the other users would have to wait
                      for it to finish, which is not an efficient use of the resources.</p>

         <h2 style='margin-top: 1.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em'>The OSI and TCP/IP Network <q>Stack</q> Models</h2>
         <p>There are a number of layers of software and firmware that assist with network communications to make
            sure that the messages get where they are going.  At the top there is the application that is working
            on your local computer to send/receive the message; this might be your web browser application, for
            example.  At the bottom is the actual <strong>transmission medium</strong> which carries the signals
            that move the data from one machine to the other.  In between though there are a number of other layers
            which have specific jobs in the process.  There are two views of these layers; each view actually is
            just a model of the overall process with some of the functionality at specific layers either combined
            or separated for clarity of the model.  One of these is called the <strong>OSI 7-layer model</strong>,
            and the other is the <strong>TCP/IP 4-layer model</strong>.</p>
         <p>Note that the TCP/IP model has the same functions as the OSI model, but they are grouped differently.
            For this reason, we'll look at the OSI model first, then define the TCP/IP model in terms of it.</p>

         <h2 style='margin-top: 1.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em'>Network Protocols</h2>
         <p>Network addresses in the browser are known as <strong>Uniform Resource Locators [URLs]</strong> and
            they have specific parts that mean things for how the file you are interested in can be found.  The
            URL starts out with a <strong>protocol indicator</strong> which tells what type of communication will
            be used.  This is what comes before the <q>://</q> in the URL line.  Next comes the <strong>web
            address</strong> which includes the domain of the server that is providing the information, i.e.,
            <q>www.lmu.edu</q> or <q>www.mozilla.org</q>.  After that comes a slash character, which is used as a
            separator, and then the directory path on the server which contains the file.</p>
         <p>For example, lets consider if we wanted to get a page called <q>woof.html</q> which is located in the
            file path <q>directory1/directory2/subdirectory/longpath</q> on the server in the domain <q>blah.gov</q>.
            To find this file we would need to get the URL line to say:</p>
         <blockquote>
            https://www.blah.gov/directory1/directory2/subdirectory/longpath/woof.html
         </blockquote>
         <p>There ARE some nice shortcuts to this, for example, if the main page on a site is named <q>index.html</q>,
            you don't have to type that, it will come up by default.  Likewise, modern browsers know to put the WWW
            on the front if you leave it off, so you only need to type in <q>google.com</q> to get the search page.</p>
         <p>The first part of this, the <q>protocol</q> part, tells the communications channel how to communicate
            over the network.  The word <em class='underline'>protocol</em> really just means an agreement, sort of
            like a contract between the two ends that says <q>here's how we'll do this transfer thing</q>.  There are
            many different types of protocols.  Some of the familiar ones are http, https, ftp, telnet, ssh, tftp,
            smtp, and of course TCP and IP which are usually seen together as TCP/IP.</p>

         <h2 style='margin-top: 1.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em'>Hardware</h2>
         <p>There is a significant amount of hardware that is required to support network operations.  We usually
            don't notice it, because it is <q>infrastructure</q> and is not in front of our faces the way our
            computers and screens are, but without it, we would not be able to watch Tik-Tok videos or stream our
            favorite NetFlix shows.</p>
         <p>As an analogy, think about roads and bridges and tunnels that facilitate our physical transportation.
            We rarely think about them, we just use them.  But without them, we'd get nowhere.</p>
         <table>
            <tr>
               <td><p>With networking, as with so many things in computer science, there are levels of
                      infrastructure that form a hierarchy.  The first thing in this chain is your computer itself.
                      Every computer [or other connected device] has hardware that helps the machine connect to the
                      network.  It can be wireless, so that the connection isn't a physical <q>thing</q> that you
                      can hold in your hand, or wired which uses a cable that plugs into your computer [assuming
                      you have the required place to plug it in!].</p>
                   <p>The lowest level device on a network is called a <strong>hub</strong>.  This is a device
                      that takes a cable which <q>feeds</q> the data into it, and several ports that distrubute
                      the data to all the other devices which are connected to it.  The distinction about a hub is
                      that it is not <q>smart</q>; any message that comes in is sent to all other devices
                      connected to the hub, and it is up to these devices to disregard messages that are not sent
                      specifically to them.</p>

               <td><p>The next-higher-level device is called a <strong>switch</strong>.  A switch is like a hub,
                      but instead of sending all the message packets to all connected devices, the switch has
                      internal software [called <strong>firmware</strong>] that can examine each packet as it
                      arrives and only forward it on to the specific device to which is is destined.  An
                      <strong>unmanaged switch</strong> has no configuration options, it is the simplest version.
                      A <strong>managed switch</strong> has the ability to be configured to modify its operation
                      to do things like set bandwidth, reject certain port destinations, activate or deactivate
                      ports on the device, or set up <strong>Virtual Local Area Networks [VLANs]</strong>.  The
                      switch uses the concept of <strong>packet switching</strong> to receive and forward data.</p>
                   <p>Moving up the hierarchy, we next meet the <strong>router</strong>.  A router is like a
                      switch on steriods.  Routers have the ability to determine not only which computer a message
                      should be sent to, but also has the ability to determine the next link [also called a
                      <strong>hop</strong>] to get to that link.  This is done by the use of a <strong>look-up
                      table</strong> in the memory of the router.  You will be familiar with routers from your
                      home network, in which the router is the distribution point for messages coming in from your
                      <strong>Internet Service Provider [ISP]</strong> to get them to the devices on your home
                      network.  [BTW, your home network can be thought of as a <strong>Local Area Network
                      [LAN]</strong>.]</p>

                   <p>Finally, we have the <strong>gateway</strong>, which is like a bridge, but this time the
                      networks that are being connected do NOT need to use the same protocols.  It is the entry
                      and exit point to a network and controls access from that network to any other network.</p>

         <h2 style='margin-top: 1.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em'>Network Commands</h2>
         <p>One of the most useful commands in the network arsenal is the lowly <strong>ping</strong> command.  If
            you type that word onto the command line, you can see if there is a connection path from your host to
            a remote host.  Fortunately, ping [in most cases] can figure out the DNS stuff so you can use domain
            names rather than numbers, but numbers work, too!  There are a ton of command line switches that you
            can use to find out lots more information.  Try using <q>man ping</q> on mac or <q>ping /?</q> on
            windows to get the full details.  Note that the command works a little differently on the two platforms
            &ndash; on windows, ping will send four messages to the remote host and then stop, while on a mac it
            will keep sending until you use <q>control+C</q> to make it quit.</p>
         <p>[ping demonstration goes here]</p>
         <p>Another useful command will help you get configuration and some status information about your network
            adapter on your host.  On windows, you can use <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> to see a ton of stuff
            including your mac address, your main IP address, IPv4 information, IPv6 information, any virtual
            network adapters information, wireless configurations, DNS lookup hosts, and more.  On mac, you use
            the command <strong>ifconfig -a</strong> to get that kind of information.</p>
         <p>[ipconfig demonstration goes here]</p>
         <p>A third handy-dandy tool is <strong>netstat</strong>, short for <q>network status</q>.  In this case,
            the same command will work for either platform, but they operate quite differently.  On mac, you have
            a large number of command line switches that limit or expand the information you'll get displayed.
            Take a look at <a href='https://linux.die.net/man/8/netstat'>the netstat man page</a> to see what I
            mean.  On windows, the default simply gives you a list of four columns that include the protocol, the
            local address, the foreigh address, and the state for each connection.  The windows version can be
            slow, too, if some of the connections have been put into the "CLOSE_WAIT" state &ndash; for those, the
            connection has to time out before it returns and the entire program must wait for each response.  Still
            it is a handy command to have to see addresses and port numbers that are active on the network.  You
            also get information about other devices that are connected, like printers, chromecast devices, and so
            on.  Nice to use if you suspect there are unauthorized devices that are connected to your wireless
            network without permission!</p>
         <p>[netstat demonstration goes here]</p>
         <p>As stated before, to communicate with each and other computers need a unique address.  A computer name,
            called a <strong>hostname</strong> is assigned to help lend a human-understandable name to each one.
            Hostnames can be alphabetic or alphanumeric, and can contain specific symbols used to define an
            individual node or device in the network.  Fortunately, the command is the same as the information it
            returns: <strong>hostname</strong>.  Also fortunately, the command is the same on both platforms.</p>
         <p>[netstat demonstration goes here]</p>
         <p>Check out the <strong>tracert</strong> command, too!  This one [short for <q>trace route</q>] will show
            you the number of hops [meaning the number of independent devices] the message goes through to reach
            the other end of the connection.  There are a few options to this one, but not too many&hellip;</p>
         <p>[tracert demonstration goes here]</p>
         <p>The <strong>nslookup</strong> command [which stands for <q>name server lookup</q>] is a utility used
            to obtain information about internet servers.  It provides name server information for the Domain Name
            System [DNS] i.e. the name and IP Address of the default DNS server.</p>
         <p>[nslookup demonstration goes here]</p>
         <p>Another useful command is the <strong>route print</strong> command, which you can use to display your
            computer's internal routing table.  Be careful with this one, though, because there are options to
            <em class='underline'>modify</em> the table as well, and you don't want to accidentally change some
            configuration and mess things up!</p>
         <p>[route print demonstration goes here]</p>
         <p>Finally, there is the <strong>ARP</strong> command.  ARP stands for <strong>Address Resolution
            Protocol</strong>.  Although network communications can readily be thought of as an IP address, the
            delivery of a packet depends ultimately on the <strong>Media Access Control [MAC]</strong>.  This is
            where the protocol for address resolution comes into effect.  You can add the remote host IP address
            using the <em class='underline'>arp -a</em> command in case you have issues communicating with a given
            host.  The ARP command provides information like Address, Flags, Mask, Interface, Hardware Type,
            Hardware Address, and more.</p>
